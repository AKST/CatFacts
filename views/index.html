      <h2>What is Catfacts.io?</h2>
      <p>
        Catfacts.io was a fun project I made to trial certain tools, and is based on
        the <a href='http://www.buzzfeed.com/mattcherette/masterful-cat-facts-texting-prank'>
        catfacts pranks</a> that was popular while back. Only this implementation
        is less spammy, and you can unsubscribe at 
        any time.
      </p>

      <h2>What happens when I subscribe?</h2>
      <p>
        When you enter your number in the field above you will be sent a confirmation
        text asking if it was really you that subscribed your own phone number. You
        can confirm or deny this by responding with Y or N.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Can I unsubscribe?</h2>
      <p>
        Once you subscribe you are told that, you can unsubscribe at any time by texting
        Q to catfacts. Once you text this, your number is removed from catfacts and you
        will no longer receive catfacts.
      </p>

      <h2>How can I trust Catfacts?</h2>
      <p>
        Catfacts is open source, meaning all it's code is freely avaible online for both 
        use, extension, miroring, criticism, and whatever else. But most importantly it means
        catfacts acts transparently so you can be sure we aren't doing any thing malicious
        with your phone number.
