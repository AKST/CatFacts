CatFacts
========
 
Catfacts is a IRL implementation of the [humorous catfacts prank](http://www.buzzfeed.com/mattcherette/masterful-cat-facts-texting-prank). So if you've ever thought, geez I wish I could have a myself some catfacts, well now you can!

But in all seriousness, this was a project to familiarise myself with some of the features of Google App Engine, and a few other client side technologies like bacon.js, underscore.js, bootstrap 3, require.js, & some of javascript's more exotic _(in my opinion)_ features like [bind & call](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15455009/js-call-apply-vs-bind)(so of these things has been removed as they were redundant).
